Since this transmitter will be connected to a \'dummy load\' (two of the parts), you do not need to be a licensed Amateur Radio operator to build and operate this transmitter. But it can transmit to a nearby (few feet) radio receiver to allow you to hear the morse code! If you are a licensed operator we will be discussing the modifications you can make to put the radio on the air and make contacts with others across the globe! The class will provide introduction to the basics of radio transmitter operation, manhattan circuit building (a technique for prototyping analog circuits), soldering, and using a test bench (oscilliscope, meter, etc...) to test and characterize your circuits. \r\n\r\nThere are six seats in the class, that are available on a first come, first served basis.

PLEASE CONTACT TEACHER TO SEE IF SEATS ARE STILL AVAILABLE\r\n\r\nIn this class you will receive a sandwich bag of nine parts and use them to assemble your own half watt radio transmitter. Since this transmitter will be connected to a \'dummy load\' (two of the parts), you do not need to be a licensed Amateur Radio operator to build and operate this transmitter. But it can transmit to a nearby (few feet) radio receiver to allow you to hear the morse code! If you are a licensed operator we will be discussing the modifications you can make to put the radio on the air and make contacts with others across the globe! The class will provide introduction to the basics of radio transmitter operation, manhattan circuit building (a technique for prototyping analog circuits), soldering, and using a test bench (oscilliscope, meter, etc...) to test and characterize your circuits. \r\n\r\nThere are six seats in the class, that are available on a first come, first served basis.

Like pieces of the Earth\'s crust, characters clash, fold, and buckle as they interact (and yes, sometimes even bump and grind!) In this class, we\'ll analyze the features of real human speech, and how to amplify and manipulate them to suit your purpose. Whether your current scene is as subtle as a tremor or as explosive as an earthquake, we\'ll craft dialogue guaranteed to keep your plot moving, your pages turning, and your audience on their toes.\r\n\r\nArianne \"Tex\" Thompson is home-grown Texas success story. After earning a bachelor’s degree in history and a master’s in literature, she channeled her passion for exciting, innovative, and inclusive fiction into the Children of the Drought – an internationally-published epic fantasy Western series from Solaris. Now a professional writing instructor and editor for the DFW Writers Conference, Tex is blazing a trail through conferences, workshops, and fan conventions around the country – as an endlessly energetic, relentlessly enthusiastic one-woman stampede.\r\n\r\nPlease read more about Tex here - http://www.thetexfiles.com/\r\n','','2016-10-09 15:00:00','2016-10-09 22:00:00','2016-10-09 15:00:00','2016-10-09 22:00:00',0.00,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,'2016-10-09 15:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',8,74,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'rffalex',1,0,'2016-08-31 16:14:42','2016-10-09 22:00:01'),(585,'Dallas Film Crew #67','Filmmakers Meeting','Setup, planning, and preps: 10:00AM\r\n\r\nFilm Crew Meeting starts at 1:00 P.M.\r\n\r\nHost/Contact: Logan Prendergast\r\nRoom: Interactive Classroom\r\nOutline of event: We will watch all of the completed flash films.\r\nMaterials needed: Bring your flash film on a thumb drive if you were one of the teams.','','2016-10-16 15:00:00','2016-10-16 22:00:00','2016-10-16 15:00:00','2016-10-16 22:00:00',0.00,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,'2016-10-16 15:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',8,74,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'rffalex',1,0,'2016-08-31 16:15:52','2016-10-16 22:00:01'),(586,'Dallas Film Crew #68','Filmmakers Meeting','Workshops, guest speakers, and hands on experience in several Film projects','','2016-10-23 15:00:00','2016-10-23 22:00:00','2016-10-23 15:00:00','2016-10-23 22:00:00',0.00,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,'2016-10-23 15:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',8,74,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'rffalex',1,0,'2016-08-31 16:16:44','2016-10-23 22:00:01'),(587,'Dallas Film Crew #69','Filmmakers Meeting','10:00 AM Preparation and planning\r\n1:00 PM Show up to meeting at this time.\r\n\r\nOutline of event: Divide into teams and create a 25 second horror film with 5 five minute clips.\r\nMaterials needed: Bring/wear your Halloween costume and any other spooky props.','','2016-10-30 15:00:00','2016-10-30 22:00:00','2016-10-30 15:00:00','2016-10-30 22:00:00',0.00,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,'2016-10-30 15:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',8,74,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'rffalex',1,0,'2016-08-31 16:18:35','2016-10-30 22:00:01'),(588,'Laser Basics','Learn how to use our 3 lasers!','Learn how to Laser, then how to use all our lasers! \r\nThe LaserSaur! \r\nThe Thunder! \r\nThe Epilog Zing! \r\nWe will spend 45-60 minutes talking about lasers work, about the file types for vectors and rastering, what materials you can etch, raster, and cut.

That means that swappers should leave with goods that are of roughly equal value to the ones they submitted for barter. To ensure a fair exchange, it\'s important to assess the value of the goods submitted and rate them accordingly. Some swaps use a democratic approach where all the items are considered of equal value, like in a book exchange. Your rules may specify bundled items of roughly equal value to ensure that everyone gets a fair deal. This makes swapping a really simple process, but it may not be flexible enough to accommodate all the items guests want to bring.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to assign tickets or pennies based on the value of an item. Here\'s how it works: \r\nA guest arrives with an item to swap. You or a helper suggests the item is worth about two pennies (or tickets) on a scale of one to five. You exchange the goods for the pennies and place the item on the two penny table. Now the guest can choose another two penny item, or if she brought two items and has four pennies to play with, can spend them at the four penny table. This requires a good eye for value and some diplomacy. Folks are usually pretty honest about what they have to exchange, though. Waiting until a few guests have arrived to establish a baseline valuation for say, a roll of ribbon as opposed to a fully illustrated book, will get you started.','','2016-10-22 20:30:00','2016-10-22 22:00:00','2016-10-22 20:00:00','2016-10-22 22:15:00',0.00,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,'2016-10-22 20:30:00',0,1,0,'completed',8,75,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'uglyknees',1,0,'2016-09-15 15:50:31','2016-10-22 22:00:01'),(741,'Nuclear Science Day at DMS','As part of National Nuclear Science Week, exhibits, demonstrations, and films on atomic energy topics.','Come and learn about topics such as radioactivity and nuclear power, as part of National Nuclear Science Week.

There is nothing mysterious about her, given how she manifests herself — perhaps even too much — in her own writing, the place where her creative life transpires in absolute fullness. What I mean is that the author is the sum of the expressive strategies that shape an invented world, a concrete world that is populated with people and events. The rest is ordinary private life.\"\r\n-    An interview with The Guardian, Feb, 2016\r\nThe recently uncovered anonymous Italian author Elena Ferrante writes anonymously for many reasons. It is believed that her willingness to remain anonymous gives her the ability to see and say what others think; to express opinions that are otherwise left undiscussed. The raw truth of the relationships her female character’s explore; the complexity and constant struggle; the opinions she, in anonymity, is able to express, unlike we that struggle to maintain the paper-thin frailty of our relationships.\r\nWhether we sit down at our desks and put pen to paper, or strike keys on screen, we’re putting a little of ourselves, one line at a time, into our work, and submitting ourselves as open books, in printed words, and offer our feedback. We cannot afford the anonymity of Elena Ferrante – we are self-conscious, invested in the little pieces of ourselves we leave in our work.\r\nFor this workshop, I want to discuss effective criticism. As we mark lines through little pieces of each other, argue over whether those little pieces would be better off here or there, sometimes we forget that those little pieces are still attached – and sometimes, we must wear gloves to handle them.\r\nIf you have a work-in-progress, please bring up to 10 pages, in standard Hollywood format, for table read and critique.','','2016-10-15 18:00:00','2016-10-15 22:00:00','2016-10-15 17:45:00','2016-10-15 22:00:00',0.00,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,'2016-10-15 18:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',8,74,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'rffalex',1,0,'2016-10-06 23:27:42','2016-10-15 22:00:01'),(921,'Jewelry Committee Meeting','New chair vote, committee update.','We will meet in the Jewelry/Small Metals area at 7pm to vote for the chair person, discuss classes/teaching and review upcoming equipment purchases.

The class will provide introduction to the basics of radio transmitter operation, Manhattan circuit building (a technique for prototyping analog circuits), soldering, and using a test bench (oscilloscope, meter, etc...) to test and characterize your circuits.\r\n','','2016-10-21 00:00:00','2016-10-21 03:00:00','2016-10-21 00:00:00','2016-10-21 03:00:00',10.00,NULL,0,6,0,13,0,'2016-10-21 00:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',7,86,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'zmetzing',1,0,'2016-10-07 03:19:43','2016-10-21 03:00:01'),(927,'Science Committee Meeting','1) Hold election for Committee Chair  2) Appoint committee officers  3) Review finances & projects 4) Discuss creation of Brewing, Automated Habitats, Automated Plant Nurseries, Raman Spectrometer, and Synthetic Bio SIGs','1) Hold election for Committee Chair\r\n2) Appoint committee officers  \r\n3) Review finances & projects \r\n4) Discuss creation of Brewing, Automated Habitats, Automated Plant Nurseries, Raman Spectrometer, and Synthetic Bio SIGs','','2016-10-16 19:00:00','2016-10-16 20:00:00','2016-10-16 19:00:00','2016-10-16 20:00:00',0.00,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,'2016-10-16 19:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',11,206,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'porky',1,0,'2016-10-07 13:43:17','2016-10-16 20:00:02'),(928,'Python For Beginners','Learn to program with the Python language.','ATTN: This event occurs on the 9th of October, starts at 7PM and ends at 8PM.

Legend Brown said that, in a way, ‘filmmakers are like God’; we have the ability to only show what we want to show through camera lenses; through the vision of the director and the operation of the cinematographer. As storytellers and screenwriters, we control the world in which our characters live, the individual wants and needs of our characters, and what happens to those characters.\r\nIn this way, stories are a lot like a winding river. We create the rhythmic ebb and flow; at parts the river widens and thins, displaces and erodes large chunks of earth to carve a new path, with the power to uproot trees, and displace millions of tons of sediment where their journey ends. Other times, the laziness of a river allows for open air naps, the quiet which allows intimacy, encourages comfort, and foreshadows the roar of a waterfall that is up ahead.\r\nWhether your viewer is travelling down roaring rapids, falling over a waterfall, or struggling under an overturned boat, it’s your creation.\r\nFor this session, our focus will be on outlining the river, in order to find the answers to these three questions:\r\n1.	What does each bend in the river, each roaring rapid, each turn accomplish? \r\n2.	What is the Human Question of this story? And does the story represent the development of that question?\r\n3.	What are the best starting point, middle, and end, of this story?\r\nFor a synopsis, any format is acceptable to bring which has a beginning, middle and end. For example:\r\n	“Mary and John went to the market for a 12-pack to hold them over until Tuesday. They grab the beer and go up to pay, but a man enters with a gun to hold up the register. John is ex-military, but he does nothing. ‘He’s just getting his.’ Once the robber leaves, the man behind the counter cries, quits his job and leaves. John leaves a $5 on the counter and leaves. Mary confronts John in the parking lot, calling him a coward. Flashback to John getting shot, starring up at his friend who had to leave him behind. Flash forward back to them at home. Mary, disgusted, leaves. John cries.”\r\nIf you have a WIP (work-in-progress), please bring up to 10-pages, in standard Hollywood format, with at least enough copies for speaking roles.\r\n','','2016-11-19 19:00:00','2016-11-19 22:00:00','2016-11-19 19:00:00','2016-11-19 22:00:00',0.00,'',0,0,0,0,0,'2016-11-19 19:00:00',0,1,0,'completed',8,74,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'rffalex',1,0,'2016-11-15 13:16:55','2016-11-19 22:00:01'),(1179,'Auditions - The Measuring Tree - Dallas Film Crew','Auditions for a Music Video','Please contact daniel@luzpictura.com if you have any questions!
